          <h2><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b></h2>
          <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah, known as the "Father of the Nation," was the primary architect behind the creation of Pakistan. As the leader of the All India Muslim League, Jinnah tirelessly advocated for the rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, leading to the demand for a separate nation. His legal acumen, eloquence, and unwavering determination were pivotal in the successful negotiation of Pakistan's independence from British rule on August 14, 1947. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan, guiding the newly formed country through its early challenges.</p>
