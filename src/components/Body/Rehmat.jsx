              <h2><b>Chaudhry Rehmat Ali</b></h2>
              <p>Chaudhry Rehmat Ali was an influential figure whose pamphlet, "Now or Never," is credited with coining the name "Pakistan." Published in 1933, the pamphlet outlined his vision for a separate Muslim state, with the name "Pakistan" representing the regions of Punjab, Afghania (North-West Frontier Province), Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan. Rehmat Ali's ideas provided a clear articulation of the demand for a separate homeland and helped popularize the notion among Muslims in the subcontinent. Although he did not play a direct role in the political negotiations leading to independence, his vision was instrumental in shaping the identity of the new nation.</p>
