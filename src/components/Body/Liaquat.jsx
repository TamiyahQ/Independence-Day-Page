              <h2><b>Liaquat Ali Khan</b></h2>
              <p>Liaquat Ali Khan was a close associate of Jinnah and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. He played a significant role in the political and administrative formation of the new country. As a trusted leader in the Muslim League, Liaquat was instrumental in shaping the policies and governance structures of Pakistan. His efforts to stabilize the economy and his leadership during the early years of independence were crucial to the survival of the nascent state. Unfortunately, his tenure was cut short by his assassination in 1951, but his contributions to Pakistan's founding are enduring.</p>
