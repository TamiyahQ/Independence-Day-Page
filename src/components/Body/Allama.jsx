          <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal was a philosopher, poet, and politician whose ideas and vision laid the intellectual groundwork for the creation of Pakistan. He is credited with articulating the concept of a separate Muslim state in his famous Allahabad Address in 1930, where he proposed the establishment of a homeland for Muslims in the northwestern regions of India. Iqbalâ€™s poetry and writings inspired a sense of unity and identity among Muslims, emphasizing the importance of spiritual and political awakening. Though he passed away before seeing the creation of Pakistan, his ideas greatly influenced the movement led by Jinnah.</p>
